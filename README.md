GDP is Monetary measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a specific time period.
In other words, the total of all value added created in an economy. 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of a country is the  accurate indicator of the size of its economy. 
Judgments regarding whether an economy requires strengthening or moderation, under threats such as a recession or rampant inflation can be made based on the GDP. 
In this project the following have been done:
Implementation of the GM (1,1) model is proposed for the prediction of the Indian GDP.
The statistical data of the Indian GDP between the years 2005 and 2017 is collected and provided as input to the GM (1,1) model to predict the future GDP. 
The  statistical parameters such as small error probability, variance, correlation, and regression measures with respect to the predicted data are analysed.
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Indian GDP is also discussed.
